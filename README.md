Feedly Java API (Abandoned)
==========

The API Lib is highly inspired and based on Google API libs.
There are some JUnit Integration Test. You can treat them as examples.

Features planned in nearest future:
* Fixes\Enhancements
* More Documentation\JUnit tests
* Maven repo?

Warning: Library API isn't stable yet!

The project is intended to be documentation and guide for Feedly API, so feel free to leave links to [Feedly Groups] related topics here. But, please, don't spam feedly dev team with the library related bugs, instead, please, report them in [github issue tracker] and I will do my best.
